# Active Fediblocks

As much as I'd want to keep things open across the entire fediverse, some instances attract some really shitty people. It does help with grouping people together to block though, I suppose...

This list is based off of the [chaos.social blocklist](https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/blocked_instances.md). Adjustments have been made to accomodate for our own ToS, as well as our own experienes.

- Suspended (mk: Blocked) ⛔: Full defederation from instance.

- Silenced (mk: Suspended) 🔇: Silenced instances don't appear in the Federated timeline, but their accounts can still
  be seen, e.g. by searching for them, by interacting with them in conversations, or by following them.

<Blocklist client:visible />

If you think an instance has been unfairly blocked, please contact me [@jojobii@mk.arks.cafe](https://mk.arks.cafe/@jojobii).
