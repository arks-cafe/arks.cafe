Just leaving this page here for archival reasons. https://mk.arks.cafe/notes/9b2c7p47t0

<blockquote>

Misskey v13 has broken (i think) the bot that was used to mirror tweets between Twitter and Misskey (https://github.com/robertoszek/pleroma-bot). I'll be closing the accounts in the upcoming days, as well as destroying the VM that the bot was running on (cuz I could use the extra bucks lol)

That being said, I'll see if I can find some alternyative methods, and possibly write up my own bot for fetching tweets; although, with recent API changes, I'm unsure if that will even be possible...

## Available Twitter -> Fediverse bots for `mk.arks.cafe`

- [@play_pso2](https://twitter.com/play_pso2) -> [@play_pso2_mirror@mk.arks.cafe](https://mk.arks.cafe/@play_pso2_mirror)

The bots update at 10 minute intervals.

Keep in mind, this is a one way mirror. Any replies will only be visible as replies to the Fediverse post, and won't be reflected onto Twitter itself.

If you have any other suggestions, let me know at [@jojobii@mk.arks.cafe](https://mk.arks.cafe/@jojobii).
