# arks.cafe rules

#### I don't really want to pull a discord admin so I'll keep this simple...

Here's a few rules from PSO2's Official Discord that I think would well if applied in this space.

> - No harassment of other players. Racism, sexism, xenophobia, transphobia, homophobia, misogyny, etc. are never allowed.
> - Keep personal drama out of chat. Harassment in chat or DMs is never allowed regardless of how you feel about others.
> - Use spoiler tags when appropriate.
> - Respect the Terms of Service & Guidelines of both Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis and Discord.

### Rule Extensions

- Reasonable NSFW is allowed, **but must be properly marked under CW**.
- Common internet etiquette stuff applies here. Just don't be rude lmao

... ngl that's pretty much it. I don't really look forward to moderating, so I trust that everyone here is a reasonable human being. If you'd like to help out with moderation here, lmk!

also quick sidenote, I swear there was like this really good "fediverse code of conduct" thing I saw at some point. If someone has a link to that, send it to me xD
