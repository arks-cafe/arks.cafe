# arks.cafe

Just a fun little project. I know, the domain is pretty sick! 😅

## Fediverse Stuff

- [Misskey (mk.arks.cafe)](https://mk.arks.cafe)
  - [PSO2 Twitter to Fediverse Bots on mk.arks.cafe](/fedi/mirror-bots)
- [arks.cafe fediverse ToS](/fedi/tos)

### Potential Future and Goals

Just because it's nice to note these things down.

- Short-Term: Be home to around 15 ARKS members (and adjacent).
- Open up a general relay at `relay.arks.cafe`
- If there's enough users to warrant it, open up a donation pool on Ko-fi to fund server costs/maintenance.
  - Scale up to a dedicated Postgres cluster for operating at a larger scale.
- Open up a Pleroma (or fork) instance at `pl.arks.cafe`

I'm keeping the `arks.cafe` domain clear just because of how nice it is and I don't wanna mess it up across the fediverse network like I did with `arks.social`...

anyways, contact me [@jojobii@mk.arks.cafe](https://mk.arks.cafe/@jojobii), or on Twitter via dm [@jojobii_](https://twitter.com/jojobii_) 👀
